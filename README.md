This code simulates SNe1987A using the  Supernova Remnant Evolution calculator (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153..239L/abstract). 
We utilize this output to visualize SNe1987A remnants and implementing an N-body simulation to test the interactions between particles over time. 
We utilize the N-body code from https://github.com/pmocz/nbody-python with few adjustments
